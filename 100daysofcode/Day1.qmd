### Tools and Data set
Python (pandas), Enrichr, g:Profiler
The data set was used from **[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE293745)**.

The CSV contains the transcriptomic data of 2 groups 

- a control group consisting of baseline C4-2B prostate cancer cell and 

- an experimental group of cell line C4-2B with amplified PCP4 production via plasmid insertion.

**[Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1616046/full)** 
is a gene which plays a role in modulating of Ca²⁺/calmodulin signaling in immune cells. It downregulates proinflamatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β. 
Cells over expressing PCP4 have disrupted calcium homeostasis, creating a calcium-rich cytosolic environment creating a vulnerability to calcium-dependent membrane and 
mitochondrial damage such as ACP's (anticancer peptides).

Although PCP4 upregulation would enhance ACP's cytotoxicity its a mutation which is typically found within early-stage tumor development and 
downregulated once metastasis begins. Counteracting the specificity provided by Mastoparan Bs, which normally targets by products of of altered cellular 
metabolism (accumulation of lactate in the cellular membrane). As a result, PCP4 upregulation and metabolic vulnerabilities rarely co-occur,
reducing the window for effective combination targeting.

### Steps

- Loaded data using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Calculated mean expression per group
- Computed log2 fold change (PCP4 vs. control)
- Filtered genes with:
  - `abs(log2FC) > 1`
  - `raw expression > 3` in either group
  
**Key problems**

Errors i encountered included only opening the VScode file within the Day 1 coding directory and not the entire folder resulting in no local acsess to 
CSV unless hardcoded. 
 *Fix*: Open entire project in VS code.
Module Not Found Error.
Pandas was downloaded on native python rather than anaconda python resulting in changing VS code python directory. 
 *Fix*: Changed VS Code’s Python interpreter.

Then i completed a top 200 upregulated [enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=d191fe2c6d54a8910b99ba6e03371b0b) to better characterize the genes.

I found MYC which controls for glycotic genes LDHA, GLUT1 was upregulated [link](https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/19/21/5835/78111/Molecular-Pathways-Targeting-MYC-induced-Metabolic), genes which promote metabolic reprogramming towards 
aerobic glycolysis (fermentation) resulting in a buildup of lactate resulting in the warburg phenotype [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20607826/).
Development of the warburg phenotype, increases the electrostatic attraction between the cationic ACP mastoparn B and the anionic cellular membrane. 

EZH2 appeared enriched in the Enrichr analysis, so out of curiosity, I checked its expression levels in the dataset using VS Code and found it was actually downregulated.
Interestingly, its known target genes were enriched and upregulated, suggesting a loss of EZH2-mediated repression. 
This derepression includes genes involved in suppressing mitochondrial function, potentially promoting a shift toward aerobic glycolysis.

Within the Top 200 downregulated genes [enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/enrich?dataset=aa81df826a74220c9ba42bfc78ee815d) i found that PRC2 components, particularly EZH2 and SUZ12, were strongly enriched as regulators of the downregulated gene set. These genes play a key role in energy function but 
dont indicate anything of interest in context to MPb.

### Conclusion
Enrichr upregulation highlighted a potential therapeutic vulnerability in PCP4-overexpressing prostate cancer cells.

- Upregulation of MYC and loss of EZH2-mediated repression results in Metabolic Reprogramming towards increased lactate production, resulting in increased targeting of mastoparan B.

- PCP4 over expression promotes intracellular calcium buildup, potentially decreasing membrane stability, therefore increasing mastoparan Bs cytotocicity.

Although PCP4 is typically not expressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), in cases where it is expressed, it could influence patient treatment decisions.
Transcriptomic profiling, as described here, could help identify such cases and exploit PCP4-associated vulnerabilities for targeted therapy with Mastoparan B.
