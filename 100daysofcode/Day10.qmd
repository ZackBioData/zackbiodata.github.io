## Problem 1: [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://rosalind.info/problems/lgis/)
>Given: A permutation œÄ of length ùëõ
Return: A longest increasing subsequence of œÄ, followed by a longest decreasing subsequence of œÄ.
[My solution](https://github.com/ZackBioData/100days-of-coding/blob/main/Day%2010%20-1%20rosiland%20problem/Longest%20Increasing%20Subsequence.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Longest Increasing/Decreasing Subsequence via Dynamic Programming

We scan forward through each position `i` in the input permutation `pi`.
At each `i`, we look back at all earlier positions `j < i` and see whether we can
extend the best subsequence ending at `j` by adding `pi[i]`.

- We maintain `L_inc[i]`: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i`.
- We maintain `P_inc[i]`: pointer to the previous index in that subsequence.

Specifically, for each `i`:
    for each `j < i`:
        if `pi[j] < pi[i]` and `L_inc[j] + 1 > L_inc[i]`:
            update `L_inc[i] = L_inc[j] + 1`
            record `P_inc[i] = j`

This reuses previously computed `L_inc[j]` values (never recomputing them)‚Äî
the hallmark of dynamic programming.  Once the tables are built, we find the
maximum `L_inc[i]`, backtrack via `P_inc` to reconstruct the actual subsequence,
and do the same for the decreasing case.

### What I learned:

- Dynamic programming: we ‚Äúlook back‚Äù at earlier positions and reuse stored best‚Äêlengths (L_inc[j] / L_dec[j]) instead of recomputing.

- DP tables (L_inc, L_dec) store the longest subsequence length ending at each index; pointer arrays (P_inc, P_dec) record where to backtrack.

- Reconstruction: once the tables are built, find the maximum entry, then follow the pointers backwards to rebuild the subsequence.

- Dual use: the same forward‚Äêscan/backtrack pattern yields both increasing and decreasing solutions in one pass (just flip the comparison).
