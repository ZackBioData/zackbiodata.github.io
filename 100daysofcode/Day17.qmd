## Overview
Today was about expanding my bioinformatics toolkit by setting up **SQL** in my local Python environment, specifically for querying large biological datasets through **Google BigQuery**.

## What I Did

- Skimmed fundamentals of probability

- Installed the `google-cloud-bigquery` Python package.

- Created a Google Cloud project and service account.

- Generated and downloaded a JSON key file for authentication.

- Learned two ways to authenticate:

  - Setting `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as an environment variable.
  - Loading the service account JSON directly in Python (preferred for portability).

- Successfully ran my first BigQuery query in Python.

- Swapped out the sample “USA Names” dataset for the **ClinVar variants** dataset, so I can directly query genetic variant data.

## Key Learnings

- **Environment setup matters**: Correct authentication is essential for BigQuery access.

- **Dataset schema inspection**: Query errors like `Unrecognized name` often mean column names are wrong—use `client.get_table()` to check the schema before writing queries.

- **Reusable client setup**: Keeping a clean “top-half” of Python code for BigQuery connection makes new queries quick to run.

- **First SQL in Python**: Successfully SELECTed, filtered, sorted, and limited data from BigQuery.
