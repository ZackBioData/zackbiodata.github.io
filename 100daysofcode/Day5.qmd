his post covers four foundational problems from rosiand, exploring GC content, Hamming distance, Mendelian inheritance, and Fibonacci-style recurrence relations. All problems were solved using Biopython


## Problem 1: [GC Content](https://rosalind.info/problems/gc/)

Calculate the GC content of multiple DNA strings in FASTA format and identify the one with the highest GC percentage.

[My solution](https://github.com/ZackBioData/100days-of-coding/blob/main/Day%205%20-%204%20rosiland%20problems/Computing%20GC%20Content.py)

```python
#https://rosalind.info/problems/gc/

from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio.Seq import Seq
from Bio.SeqUtils import gc_fraction
import os


# Get directory of the current script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
fasta_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "rosalind_gc.fasta")
records = list(SeqIO.parse(fasta_path, "fasta"))

# Track highest GC content and ID
max_gc = 0
max_id = ""
# Loop over each record and calculate GC content
for record in records:
    gc = gc_fraction(record.seq) * 100  # get % value
    if gc > max_gc:
        max_gc = gc
        max_id = record.id

# Print results
print(max_id)
print(f"{max_gc:.6f}")
```
### What I learned:

- `gc_fraction` from `Bio.SeqUtils` gives clean GC percentages.
- Looping through `SeqIO` records helps to process multiple sequences efficiently.
- Comparing and tracking values is easy using standard `if` logic





## Problem 2: [Hamming Distance](https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/)
Compute the number of differing characters between two DNA strings of equal length.

[My solution](https://github.com/ZackBioData/100days-of-coding/blob/main/Day%205%20-%204%20rosiland%20problems/Counting%20Point%20Mutations.py)
```python
# https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/

from Bio import SeqIO
import os


# Get directory of the current script
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
fasta_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "rosalind_hamm.fasta")
records = list(SeqIO.parse(fasta_path, "fasta"))

for i in range(len(records)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(records)):
        # Calculate Hamming distance
        seq1 = records[i].seq
        seq2 = records[j].seq
        hamming_distance = sum(el1 != el2 for el1, el2 in zip(seq1, seq2))
        print(hamming_distance)
```

### What I learned:
- `zip(seq1, seq2)` lets you pair corresponding elements.
- The comparison `el1 != el2` returns `True` for mismatches (which equals `1` when summed).
- `sum(...)` neatly counts total differences without explicit loops.

## Problem 3: [Hamming Distance](https://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/)
Given the number of homozygous dominant (AA), heterozygous (Aa), and homozygous recessive (aa) individuals in a population,
 compute the probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele.

[My solution](https://github.com/ZackBioData/100days-of-coding/blob/main/Day%205%20-%204%20rosiland%20problems/Mendel's%20First%20Law.py)

```python
# https://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/
AApop = 29
Aapop = 17
aapop = 22

totalpop = AApop + Aapop + aapop

#                             aA                                          AA                                                 aa                                                   Aa
aaoutcome = ((aapop/totalpop) * ((Aapop)/(totalpop-1))*0.5) + ((Aapop/totalpop) * ((Aapop-1)/(totalpop-1))*0.25) + ((aapop/totalpop) * ((aapop-1)/(totalpop-1))) + ((Aapop/totalpop) * ((aapop)/(totalpop-1))*0.5)




Aoutcome = (1 - aaoutcome) * 100


print(f"{Aoutcome:.2f}% of the offspring will have a dominant allele")
```

### What I learned:

- Probability trees help remove errors.
- The cleanest solution subtracts P(recessive) from 1 to get P(dominant)

## Problem 3: [Rabbits and Recurrence Relations](https://rosalind.info/problems/fib/)

[My solution](https://github.com/ZackBioData/100days-of-coding/blob/main/Day%205%20-%204%20rosiland%20problems/Rabbits%20and%20Recurrence%20Relations.py)

```python
months = 36
litter_size = 2

prev = 1  # F(n-2)
curr = 1  # F(n-1)

for _ in range(3, months + 1):
    next_rabbits = curr + litter_size * prev
    prev, curr = curr, next_rabbits

print(months, curr)
#curr = number of pairs last month (F(n−1)).
#prev = number of pairs two months ago (F(n−2)).
```

### What I learned:
- Clean recurrence: F(n) = F(n−1) + k * F(n−2).
