A logbook documenting my journey through bioinformatics.

- [2025-05-23 — Prostate Cancer DEG (GSE6919)](2025-05-23_prostate-limma.qmd)
bulk RNA sequencing **(microarray data)** from the GEO dataset **GSE6919** to identify genes that are differentially expressed between **cancerous and healthy prostate tissues**. The analysis was performed using the `limma` package in R.

- [2025-08-04 — Mastoparan B Variant Panel (ClinVar)](2025-08-04_MPb-geneticvariants.qmd)  
Used a local ClinVar VCF to extract variants in **calcium-buffering and metabolic genes** that may influence susceptibility to **Mastoparan B**–induced apoptosis. Focused on genes like `PCP4`, `ATP2B1`, `BCL2`, and `MYC`.
